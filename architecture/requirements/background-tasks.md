- Tasks should be defined in code for proper revisioning and readability.
- Tasks that need to get executed (for example a confirmation for Tip payment) need to be executed with a backend that supports retrying and receipts.

## User Stories

### Admin

- As an admin I should be able to see and search from local logs fror any tasks and their status.
