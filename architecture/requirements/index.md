# Requirements

## General

- Frontend and backend should get very high (> 80) points from [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/).
- Frontend should get near-100 points from [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) test.
- Both frontend and backend code sould be deployed via a fully automatic CI/CD procress.
- All API traffic should have audition logs. (And we should provide users a log of their own activities for security purposes.)
- We should write the API with speed in mind. The current API is implemented in very ad-hoc way and is difficult to optimize. Most simple queries should return in the order of 20-50 ms instead of the current 200-500 ms.
