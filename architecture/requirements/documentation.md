Documentation is an important part of a well designed software. Based on [Writing Great Documentation](https://jacobian.org/series/great-documentation/) by Jacob Kaplan-Moss, and [the documentation system by Divio](https://documentation.divio.com/), we should cover following document types:

- Introduction
- Tutorials
- How-to guides
- Explanation (overview)
- Reference

- Announcements (like release notes but on a single topic)

- Contribution guide
