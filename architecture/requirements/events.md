## Tehchnical

- V2 event fat models have become seriously obese. (The DJ-related app models.py is over 1600 lines long, user-related one is nearly 900 lines.) These need to be splitted into multiple packages and especially the main event model needs to be completely refactored to make it more lean.

## User Stories

### DJ

- As a DJ I should be able to start an event with zero-configuration, just by starting my streamer.
- As a DJ I should be able to schedule my event far into the future.
- As a DJ I should be able to get a modern and well-working marketing page for my scheduled events after putting in proper metadata and content.
