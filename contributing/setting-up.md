# Setting Up Development Environment

### Git

Make sure your Git installation knows your name and email:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Real Name"
git config --global user.email "you@email.com"
```

If you don't want to change your global configuration, you can set these also per-repository by editing `.git/config` in each repo.

Also make sure that your profile settings are correct in GitLab.
