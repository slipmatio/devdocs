# Slipmat3 Developer Docs

The next evolution of Slipmat.io is in the works and this is the public **developer documentation** for the work. Please note that this is a **work in pogress**, so unless explicitly stated, nothing you see here is to be considered final.

## Latest updates

- Started a new project from clean slate for Slipmat Admin for figuring out the best way to build new user-facing UIs for artists and users. This is based on Vue 3, automatically tested with Cypress and automatically deployed via Vercel.
