# Slipmat3 Developer Docs

The next evolution of Slipmat.io is in the works and this is the public **developer documentation** for the work. Please note that this is a **work in progress**, so unless explicitly stated, nothing you see here is to be considered final.

## Latest updates

- Published [@slipmatio/logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@slipmatio/logger) and [@slipmatio/tailwind-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@slipmatio/tailwind-config) packages on NPM. These are our first public and open source NPM packages!
