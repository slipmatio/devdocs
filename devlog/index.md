# Dev Log

## February 2020

- Created first tickets for requirements and [built a dynamic list on the requirements page](/architecture/requirements/index.md) that shows the progress of the work.
- Started fleshing out [technical requirements](/architecture/requirements/index.md). This is going to be a big project in itself, but in the end very useful to be able to plan out the work and schedule.
- Sketched out [Slipmat 1, 2 and 3 architectures](/architecture/diagrams.md) based on an old diagram.
- Created (these) docs + started this dev log
- Posted [Slipmat.io Development Update 2/2020](https://backstage.slipmat.io/t/slipmat-io-development-update-2-2020/1864) to Backstage.

## January 2020

- More planning, made some initial software and hosting decisions. (Decided against K8s in favour of a lighter Traefik-based solution but still running on Docker.)

## Late 2019

- Designing, planning and some light prototyping.
- Created the repository on 2019-10-09.
