# Development Log

These are short daily logs about the development process. Read also [development notes](./notes.md) for random thought and ideas that are bubbling behind the scenes.

## February 2020

!!!include(latest_devlogs.md)!!!

## January 2020

- Created the code project and deployed next.slipmat.io + api.slipmat.io. There is no functionality yet but the main development environment is now working and deployments are tested + fully automatic.
- More planning, made some initial software and hosting decisions. (Decided against K8s in favour of a lighter Traefik-based solution but still running on Docker.)

## Late 2019

- Designing, planning and some light prototyping.
- Created the repository on 2019-10-09.
